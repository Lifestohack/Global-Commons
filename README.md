# Global-Commons
I was always involved in one way or another in projects where I had to different kinds of software development. I am not full time software developer but again being involved in some development projects, I decided to write a Framework for myself that I can use again and again.

Each and every time I was involved in some projects there were similar things that I was doing. So I decided to make the framework for those similar things so that it is not redundant in every projects.
