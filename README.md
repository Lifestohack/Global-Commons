I am always involved in one way or another in projects where I had to do different kinds of software development. Each and every time I was involved in some projects there were similar things that I was doing. So I decided to make the framework for those similar things so that it is not redundant in each and every projects.

Read properties file 
      first make a class that reads properties file     
      and then make another class that read 
      properties file for test purpose
